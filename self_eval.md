# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
6/10 it's not so much the methods themselves, it's knowing HOW they work, and HOW they interact with each other and the variables that's giving me issues so far.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
5/10 I feel better following my foray into learning the rules of how methods are defined and how variables interact with them.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
How do I define a method within an array in a simple way? For example, I have multiple arrays of different lengths, with different integers in each and I want my method to remove a random integer from each array and place it in a new array, then repeat this until one of the original arrays runs out of values, is that possible?
